\textbf{ABSTRACT:}

We built two Applications (TTS \& STT) for interconversion between text
and speech signal. Text to speech makes the online world and beyond
available to people with learning disabilities, visual impairments, and
literacy challenges. While speech to text saves a lot of typing time.
Two separate Graphic User Interfaces (GUI) are built of these tasks
using python tkinter library. TTS applications turn text-based content
into audio and enable all users to access information and communicate
with others. While STT does the reverse. The SST module also allows
searching converted text on the web(Google Search). We use python's
pysttx3 library for TTS and python's speech\_recognition library for STT
respectively.Active internet connection is needed for speech to text
conversion.

INTRODUCTION:}{ INTRODUCTION:}}\label{introduction}

\begin{quote}
Text-to-speech (TTS) convention transforms linguistic information stored
as data or text into speech. It is widely used in audio reading devices
for blind people now a days .Audiobook is one of many application of
TTS.In recent times, the use of text-to-speech conversion has grown far
beyond the disabled community to become a major adjunct to the rapidly
growing use of digital voice storage for voicemail and voice response
systems. Also developments in Speech synthesis technology for various
languages have already taken place. On other hand, Speech-To-Text (SST)
converts speech signal to text signal. Main applications for this
conversion are online assistants( Google Assistant, Siri, etc.). SST can
save a lot of energy and time required for typing. Authors can use this
for writing books, journals, etc.

TTS and STT both are useful in many areas like banking-ﬁnance sector
,ATM, healthcare, learning , publish-media etc.But we have selected this
topic mainly focussing on two sectors namely EDUCATION and HEALTH .We
choose this problem is due to its wide

application in remote areas and health sector. We build the application
with limited resources available with us here we want to show its usage
and expand its availability. We wanted to limit use of the internet so
that it can be useful in remote areas. It can be useful to areas like
hospitals where with just this application they can inform the
information to each and every patient. In situations like pandemic this
can play a vital role for spreading news or any notice to anywhere(not
restricted to hospital,can also be in places like a civil court,police
station etc) without using a piece of paper or pen as it may cause
spread of the pandemic disease. Apart from this it can make life easier
for people with disabilities. In India if we can implement this simple
idea in any school(normal or schools for disabled) then it may help them
to learn things and share their point of views without any problem and
hesitations.Along with this it can also make their life easy , smoothing
and self conﬁdent.TTS is very beneﬁcial for blind students while SST is
very useful for deaf students. For all this problem on ground level
there is no such prominent solutions are visible in our day to day
life.By introducing this idea among deaf people where they were using
old methods(like sign language) or in hospitals(old pen-paper technique)
it can create a great impact in their lives.We are not here ensuring
that this is the only 100\% eﬀective solution but then also we have
tried make it a light user friendly GUI which is not going to use
internet to convert text to speech.Also the speech i.e audio ﬁle will
also get stored in the system itself so that record can be maintained
for audio ﬁles. On other hand speech to text requires active internet
connection.

\section{LITERATURE SURVEY:}\label{literature-survey}

\begin{quote}
During this project we analysed and understood the concepts for speech
to text conversion and for vice-versa.We also learned about various
libraries of python which made possible to create GUI for our idea and
application.For this we searched various websites,videos and papers for
the useful content.

Some of the websites which made our work easier are:

\subsubsection{METHODOLOGY:}\label{methodology}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{TTS:}

\includegraphics[width=2.69289in,height=2.11510in]{image1.jpeg}

\textbf{Input Text}: Our Text-To-Speech GUI contains mainly two types of
input Options i.e the ﬁrst one is the user can import the text nothing
but .txt extension ﬁle from any directory of his/her device.And also the
another option is user can enter anything in the given text box so that
it can be converted to speech.Text language must be English.

\textbf{Front-End: Text Normalization / Pre Processing}:The front end
does two functions, the ﬁrst of which is to convert raw text containing
symbols, such as, number and abbreviations into equivalent words.This
process is termed as normalization or pre-processing or tokenization. As
part of a text-to-speech (TTS) system, the text normalization component
is typically one of the ﬁrst steps in the pipeline, converting raw text
into a sequence of words, which can then be passed to later components
of the system, including word pronunciation, prosody prediction, and
ultimately waveform generation.

\textbf{Phonetic Transcription} : The second function is to assign
phonetic transcription to each word. The front end converts each
phonetic until of the text into units like phrase, clauses and
sentence.This process of assigning phonetic transcription to words is
called text-to-phoneme conversion. Phonetics transcription and prosody
information together will form the symbolic linguistics
representation.The front interfaces always engage with phonetic
conversion to each unit, and divides and marks to form a speech tree or
pattern tree using the speech unit which conﬁgures the tune and rhythm
through phrases, clauses, and sentences. This process of transcription
is known as text-to-phoneme (TTP) or grapheme-to-phoneme (GTP)
conversion.

\textbf{Back-End: Synthesizer} : The back-end---oGen referred to as the
synthesizer---then converts the symbolic linguistic representation into
sound. The back-end will also include the computation of the target
prosody such as pitch counter, phoneme duration which are then imposed
speech output.The Text can be converted to speech using pyttsx3.It is a
text-to-speech conversion library in Python.It uses native speech
drivers when available and works completely oﬄine.

\textbf{Output Speech}: AGer pre-processing and synthesis of text the
speech is generated.The speech is the output in this Text-To-Speech GUI.

\textbf{STT:}
\end{quote}

\includegraphics[width=2.58926in,height=1.20792in]{image2.png}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Input Speech:} Speech signal is inputted from the user using a
microphone on the device.Allow Since the surrounding noise may vary, we
allow the program a second or too to adjust the energy threshold of
recording so it is adjusted according to the external noise level. This
is done using

\textbf{Convert Speech to Text:} We use recognise\_google() for this.
It's working is as follows.Voice activity detectors (VADs) are used to
reduce an audio signal to only the portions that are likely to contain
speech. This prevents the recognizer from wasting time analyzing
unnecessary parts of the signal. Speech must be converted from physical
sound to an electrical signal with a microphone, and then to digital
data with an analog-to-digital converter. Once digitized, the signal's
power is obtained as a function of frequency. Then it is mapped to a
vector of real numbers.To decode the speech into text, groups of vectors
are matched to one or more phonemes---a fundamental unit of speech.

\textbf{Output the text:} Output is produced on text box in the
application

\textbf{Google search speech(if needed):} If user asks to search the
resluted text in internet, this is done by clicking on Google symbol
which essentially gets contents in text box and search it in Google
using open\_new\_tab() function in webbrowser library.

\section{Conclusion:}\label{conclusion}

\begin{quote}
Text-to-Speech synthesizers have steadily developed from the last few
decades to gain the current shape. It's never been so easy to use a
text-to-speech program, as just one click and your computer will speak
any text aloud in a clear, natural sounding voice. We have identiﬁed the
various operations and processes involved in text to speech synthesis.
We have also developed a very simple and attractive graphical user
interface which allows the user to type in his/her text provided in the
text ﬁeld in the application. Our system interfaces with a text to
speech engine developed for American English.We have also implemented it
successfully in the marked needy areas.Also in future we will be trying
it to add more and more regional and international languages so that
linguistic barrier will be demolished.Also for speech to text converter
we will try to make it completely oﬄine.
